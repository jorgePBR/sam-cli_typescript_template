## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with Administrator permission
* [nodejs10.x installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/)
* [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
* Typescript installed

## Packaging and deployment

An S3 bucket must be created before deployment to hold the lambda code:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://BUCKET_NAME
```

Set the follow environment variables:
```bash
export S3_BUCKET=
export STACK_NAME=
```

```bash
# Build and test during development
make

# Build, Package and Deploy
make deploy-stack
```

Individual lambda functions can be tested using the SAM CLI:
```bash
# Updates the handler.zip lambda package that SAM references
make local-package

sam local invoke <LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME>
```

#### Packaging notes:
- The `devDependencies` are installed in order for `tsc` to compile the TypeScript code to Javascript
- The dev `node_modules` are then removed and the production dependencies are installed and zipped in the lambda package
